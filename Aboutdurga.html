		<h5>THE BIRTH OF DEVI DURGA</h5>
		<p align="justify">
		The legends speak of Goddess Durga as a creation of the three most powerful Devas (Gods) in the Hindu Pantheon – Brahma (the creator), Vishnu (the preserver) and Shiva (the destroyer). The story of Durga’s birth is narrated in the Devi Bhagvatam. According to this sacred text, once a son called Mahishasura was born to an Asura (demon). Born as an Asura, he saw the victory of Devas over Asuras in every fight. Annoyed by the constant defeat of the Asuras, Mahishasura decided to perform a tapasaya (a long penance) to please the Devas. Years went by.Impressed by Mahishasura’s dedication, Lord Brahma decided to grant him a boon. Elated at such an opportunity, Mahishasura asked Brahma to bless him such that neither a man nor a God could kill him. Thus, his death would lie only in the hands of a woman – which in his mind was impossible. Taking advantage of the boon, Mahishasura, along with his troop of Asuras, invaded the Earth. He looted and killed with impunity. Soon, raging with power, he decided to take over heaven believing he could be the ruler of all the three realms. The battle between the Asuras and the Devas was ferocious. Mashishasura finally defeated the army of Indra in Amravati. Humiliated, the Devas met with theTridevas, hoping to find a solution.

		<p align="justify">
		Frustrated and angry at the defeat of the Devas, the Tridevas started to think. “Only a woman can kill Mahishasura” said Lord Brahma, thinking about the boon he had given the Asura. But which woman in the three realms was strong enough to take on the battle? The Tridevas put their minds together and using their powers created energy that took the form of Devi Durga. Each of the Devas gave their weapon to the Devi to help her kill Mahishasura. Himavat, the God of Himalaya, gave the Devi a Lion to mount on.

		<h5>HISTORY OF THE PUJA</h5>
		<p align="justify">
		Celebrated in the month of Ashvin (September – October), Durga puja (fondly referred to as Pujo) is one of the most awaited festivals in India, especially in West Bengal. Even though the weather starts becoming cooler, the air is thick with the warmth radiated by the devotees.
		</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The origins of the Devi as a deity are lost in the mists of time. Over time, we find mentions of the Goddess in various texts from the Vedic era and also in the Ramayana and Mahabharata. Even much later, Krittivasi’s rendition of Ramayana, composed in the 15th century, speaks of Durga being worshipped with 108 blue lotuses and 108 sacred lamps by Lord Rama before his battle with Ravana. The day that Lord Rama defeated Ravana is celebrated as Dussehra which falls on the tenth day (Dashami) of the Durga puja.
		</p>
		<p align="justify">
			In literature from around the 16th century we find the first mentions of the grand celebration of Durga puja by zamindars (landlords) in West Bengal. Different scripts point to different rajas (kings) and zamindars who celebrated and financed the Durga puja for the whole village. The Boendo Bariri Pujo (Puja in the house of zamindars) still remains a custom in Bengal. The bigger households, place the idol in their courtyards of their havelis for people to come and pray to the Goddess Durga.
		</p>
		<p align="justify">
			One of the most famous institutions of Kolkata is the Belur Math. The headquarters of Ramakrishna Math and Mission, Belur Math was founded by Swami Vivekanand. Established on the western bank of the Hoogly river, this Math hosts a very popular Durga puja. The first Durga puja here was held in 1901 by Swami Vivekananda himself. Initially, celebrated inside a small pandal, the Durga puja at Belur Math now attracts thousands of people every year.
